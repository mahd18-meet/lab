## Housekeeping
- How to properly save files so that they do not create merge conflicts:
	* 1. Create a new folder called "[YOUR_NAME]" (where YOUR_NAME = Melanie or Maria or Fawzi, etc.) 
	* 2. If you are editing a lecture or homework file, please save it in this folder
	* 3. Add this folder to your .gitignore file so that it is not pushed online every time you update it
