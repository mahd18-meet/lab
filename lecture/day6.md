## Introducing React 
- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces - what you see on the webpage
- Often used for single-page applications, ones that do not require re-loading a page in order to display new content
- It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”
- `render` method returns a description of what you'd like to see on the webpage
	* JSX is a special syntax that is transformed into React elements at build time
